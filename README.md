Before we begin breaking the code into a step by step format : 

## 1 -  SOURCE CODE : 

soruce_code.py

## 2- OUTPUTS : 


This code is a simple calculator GUI (Graphical User Interface) implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. 
Let's break down the code step by step:


## 3 - CODE BREAKDOWN : 

### 3.1 - Import Tkinter:

```
from tkinter import *

```
This line imports all classes and functions from the Tkinter library, which is used for creating GUI applications.

### 3.2 - Create the main window:

```
me = Tk()
me.geometry("354x460")
me.title("DARSHAN_CALCULATOR")

```
This initializes the main window (me) with a size of 354x460 pixels and sets the title to "CALCULATOR."

### 3.3 -
